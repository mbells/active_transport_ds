[Traffic signals](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:highway%3Dtraffic_signals)
Traffic signals, also known as traffic lights, traffic lamps, signal lights and stop lights are signalling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, bicycle crossings, and other locations to control competing flows of traffic. 

[Crossings](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Crossings)

A crossing is a junction between two paths or highways intended for different modes of transportation, potentially requiring traffic to stop to let other traffic pass. Although intersections generally do not have explicit tags, several kinds of crossings have the explicit tags below plus a variety of additional tags describing the crossing.
